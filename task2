Task-2
1. What are the units of the signal amplitude and FAS amplitude? Add it as the y-label of the plot.
2. Convert the .py or .m script into a code that loops over all the .txt files present in the directory. You can use jupyter notebook as well
3. Validate the Fourier spectra amplitude of the event with the corresponding amplitude reported in the ESM flatfile. Check for the corresponding event id in the flatfile.
